      "Summary: Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\n",
      "Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\n",
      "Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century, with 2024 the warmest on record at +1.60 °C (2.88 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 °C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century. Limiting warming to 1.5 °C would require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n",
      "There is widespread support for climate action worldwide. Fossil fuel use can be phased out by conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution. These energy sources include wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power. Cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes. Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.\n",

      "Page: Greenhouse gas emissions\n",
      "Summary: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities intensify the greenhouse effect. This contributes to climate change. Carbon dioxide (CO2), from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, is the main cause of climate change. The largest annual emissions are from China followed by the United States. The United States has higher emissions per capita. The main producers fueling the emissions globally are large oil and gas companies. Emissions from human activities have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial le\u001b[0m\n",

      "\n",
      "We've also learned about the importance of reducing emissions to limit warming to 1.5°C or below. This can be achieved by transitioning to cleaner energy sources, increasing forest cover, and adopting sustainable land-use practices.\n",

    "## Building a Custom Agent with LangGraph (Step-by-Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the notebook demonstrates how to build a **simple, explainable agent** using **LangGraph**, mimicking the behavior of a LangChain `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` agent — but with full control over its logic, flow, and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is the same as the previous example, so you are on familiar ground, but the interest is that LangGraph allows you to build your own agent and its structure, so you can go beyond pre-canned tools.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Step 1: Set Up Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This step loads and prepares everything needed to power the agent's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions and Components Used:**\n",
    "- `TextLoader`: Loads the `climate.txt` document from disk.\n",
    "- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`: Splits the document into overlapping chunks for better semantic search.\n",
    "- `OllamaEmbeddings`: Creates vector embeddings using a local model (e.g., `mxbai-embed-large`).\n",
    "- `Chroma`: Stores those embeddings for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "- `Ollama`: Runs the local language model (`llama3`) used for answering.\n",
    "- `RetrievalQA`: A wrapper that connects the retriever and the LLM.\n",
    "- `WikipediaAPIWrapper`: A tool that performs a Wikipedia search as a fallback.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Purpose:** These tools form the basis for all reasoning and information retrieval used later by the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Step 2: Define the Agent's State\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph requires a formal declaration of what data flows through your graph. This step defines that shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure: `QAState`**\n",
    "- `question`: The user’s query.\n",
    "- `rag_answer`: Stores the answer if the RAG tool was used.\n",
    "- `wiki_answer`: Stores the answer if the Wikipedia tool was used.\n",
    "- `answer`: The final answer to return. This key is marked with `Annotated[..., \"output\"]` so LangGraph knows to treat it as a **single-write endpoint**.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Purpose:** Controls the input, intermediate, and output values handled by each node in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Step 3: Routing Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the \"agentic brain\" — a custom Python function that decides *which tool to use* based on the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function: `tool_selector(state)`**\n",
    "- Inspects `state[\"question\"]`\n",
    "- If the question contains the word `\"climate\"`, it returns `{\"__next__\": \"rag\"}`\n",
    "- Otherwise, it returns `{\"__next__\": \"wiki\"}`\n",
    "\n",
    " **Purpose:** Simulates an intelligent decision-maker — your own custom routing logic instead of relying on a hardcoded or LLM-parsed policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Step 4: Define Graph Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node is a callable function that:\n",
    "- Accepts the current state\n",
    "- Returns a dictionary with updated values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Node Functions:**\n",
    "- `rag_node(state)`: Calls the RAG tool and stores the output in `rag_answer`.\n",
    "- `wiki_node(state)`: Calls Wikipedia and stores the output in `wiki_answer`.\n",
    "- `merger(state)`: Consolidates the answers. If `rag_answer` is present, it uses it. Otherwise, it falls back to `wiki_answer`. The result is stored in `answer`.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Purpose:** These nodes act like \"agent limbs\" — executing concrete actions depending on what the brain (`tool_selector`) decided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Step 5: Build the Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we assemble the agent as a directed graph of reasoning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "- Instantiate the graph: `graph = StateGraph(QAState)`\n",
    "- Add nodes: router, rag, wiki, merger\n",
    "- Connect edges:\n",
    "  - `router → rag`\n",
    "  - `router → wiki`\n",
    "  - `rag → merger`\n",
    "  - `wiki → merger`\n",
    "  - `merger → END`\n",
    "- Compile the graph: `agent = graph.compile()`\n",
    "\n",
    " **Purpose:** This defines the possible paths an input can take — making the reasoning traceable and testable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Step 6: Run the Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "We finally invoke the agent with a natural language question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invocation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "question = \"What causes the most CO2 emissions?\"\n",
    "result = agent.invoke({\"question\": question})\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
