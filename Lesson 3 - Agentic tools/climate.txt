Climate change refers to significant and lasting changes in the Earth's climate and weather patterns. The primary driver of recent climate change is human activity, particularly the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).

The largest contributor to CO2 emissions is the burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation. This includes coal-fired power plants, gasoline-powered vehicles, and industrial processes like cement production. Deforestation also contributes by reducing the planet's ability to absorb CO2.

Climate change results in global warming, rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems. It affects agriculture, water supply, biodiversity, and human health.

To address climate change, strategies include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and implementing policies like carbon pricing. Global cooperation, as seen in the Paris Agreement, is essential to limit warming to well below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels.

Adaptation measures, such as building flood defenses, improving infrastructure, and developing drought-resistant crops, are also critical to cope with the changes already underway.
